<p>Here are some of the things law did for preprocessing his filter banks</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Conversion to Grayscale</h3>
<p>This step ensures that the image contains only intensity information, which is relevant for texture analysis</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Resize and Padding</h3>
<p>The grayscale image is optionally resized to a fixed size or aspect ratio to ensure consistency across
  different images. Additionally, padding may be applied to the image to obtain a square image, which
  simplifies the filter bank computations. The padding can be done by extending the image edges or filling
  with appropriate values</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Local Contrast Normalization</h3>
<p> Law applied local contrast normalization to the grayscale image. This step helps to enhance the
  texture details and reduce the influence of overall illumination variations. Local contrast normalization
  can be performed by subtracting the local mean from each pixel and dividing by the local standard deviation.
  It ensures that the image has a consistent contrast distribution across different regions.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Centering</h3>
<p>The normalized image is centered by subtracting the global mean value of the image from each pixel.
  This step helps to eliminate any global intensity variations and ensures that the filter bank response
  is primarily based on local texture variations.</p>
