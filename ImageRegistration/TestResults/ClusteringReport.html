<h1>Report on Clustering</h1>
    <p>
        This document discusses some of the rudimentary clustering
        that was done on the law's texture features.
        The code where this is done is located in TextureEnergy.py
    </p>

    <p>
        The hope is that the textures present in the area of the obstruction
        will be separable by clustering. THe thought being there should be 2
        unique clusters: the obstruction textures and the unobstructed textures.

        The original image was a picture of a display failure. It can be seen below.
        No relevant preprocessing was done to the image apart from correcting the orientation.

<h2>What was done</h2>
    <p>
        The 5 texture vectors were multiplied in a pairwise manner to
        create 25 texture filters of shape 5 by 5.
        The image was convolved with the 25 filters at each color channel
        to create a 75 layer image of textures. Below is the cumulative variance of the first
        15 principle components.
    </p>

    <p>
        A rudimentary k-means clustering of k=2 was applied to the 75 layers of textures.
        Here is what that looks like:

            Includes a k-means cluster with 2 centroids.

    </figure>

    <p>
        Just based on the shape of the first 2 principle components
        in the graph above, I don't think the micro law's texture
        features gives high potential to be learned in an unsupervised
        manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        I think it is worth attempting with the images in grayscale.
        Will do that below.
