<h1>About The First Test Set</h1>

<p>
    I'm making a test set of obstructions and displays. It's more like a test suite than a test set.
</p>

<p>
    I have two different dashboards, four different obstructions. Each obstruction was placed on each dashboard in 2
    different locations to create a 16 total samples by pairing the different dashboards, obstructions, and locations
    in a combinatorial manner.
</p>

<p>Each test case will occupy a unique folder. Each test case will have the following things with it. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>expected - expected display output. It is not obstructed.</li>
        <li>obstructed - obstructed display output. Not a picture, rather the expected with the obstruction overlayed.</li>
        <li>obstructionmask - Black and white image of where the obstruction is located. This is a sort
        of ground truth.</li>
        <li>query - a picture of the actual output. This would include the obstruction.
        Has been morphed to be rectangular.</li>
    </ul>
